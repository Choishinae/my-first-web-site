    This article is about particles suspended in air. For general discussion of particulate types, see Particle § Distribution of particles. For other uses, see Particulates (disambiguation). Particulates – also known as atmospheric aerosol particles, atmospheric particulate matter, particulate matter (PM) or suspended particulate matter (SPM) – are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, as opposed to the particulate matter alone.[1]
